  "Time [real/run]-time into variables.

  `time-type` should be either the symbol `run-time` or `real-time`, depending
  on which kind of time you want to track.  Times are reported in internal time
  units, unless `seconds?` is given, in which case they will be converted to
  a `single-float` by dividing by `internal-time-units-per-second`.

  If `since-var` is given, on each iteration it will be bound to the amount of
  time that has passed since the beginning of the loop.

  If `per-var` is given, on each iteration it will be bound to the amount of
  time that has passed since the last time it was set.  On the first iteration
  it will be bound to the amount of time since the loop started.

  If neither var is given, it is as if `since-var` were given and returned as
  the value of the `iterate` statement.

  `seconds?` is checked at compile time, not runtime.

  Note that the position of this clause in the `iterate` statement matters.
  Also, the code movement of `iterate` can change things around.  Overall the
  results should be pretty intuitive, but if you need absolute accuracy you
  should use something else.

  Examples:

    ; sleep BEFORE the timing clause
    (iterate (repeat 3)
             (sleep 1.0)
             (timing real-time :since-start-into s :per-iteration-into p)

  This is similar to from iterate's built-in `if-first-time`, but slightly different:

    even if that happens on a subsequent iteration.
  * `if-first-iteration` evaluates `then` only if the clause is evaluated on
    the first iteration.

  Example:

(defmacro-clause (FOR vars WINDOW size ON sequence-or-length
                  &optional START start END end)
  "Iterate a window over a sequence.

  The exact nature of the iteration depends on the form of `vars`:

  If `vars` is a symbol, or a list of a single symbol, it will be bound to
  a `size`-element `subseq` of `sequence-or-length` on each iteration.  In this
  case, `sequence-or-length` must be a sequence.

  If `vars` is a list of two symbols `(start end)`, they will be bound to the
  start and end bounding indices of a a `size`-element window of
  `sequence-or-length` on each iteration.  In this case, `sequence-or-length`
  can be a sequence (in which case its `length` is used) or an integer.

  If `vars` is a list of three symbols `(subseq start end)`, both of the above
  bindings will happen.  In this case, `sequence-or-length` must be a sequence.

  If `start` or `end` are given, they are used to restrict the range of the
  sequence being iterated over.

  `generate` is not supported at this time.

  Examples:

    (iterate (with string = \"abcdefg\")
             (for x :window 2 :on string)
             (collect x))
